# _Things To Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension_ Addition

The code challenges contained herein are inspired by the book, _Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension_ by Matt Parker
Link to the book [here](https://makeanddo4d.com/).

These challenges will be a lot less guided that the other ones I have done. I won't be making seeds for the different
languages, and I may or may not be supplying my usual `answers.json` (in some cases, this may be because I haven't
solved it yet myself.) There will still be a readme with the outline of the challenge as well as a submissions folder
for you to add to.

With that, the submission process remains the same. Please make your submission PRs to the submissions branch of 
this repo.

Happy mathing! (oh, and programming too)
