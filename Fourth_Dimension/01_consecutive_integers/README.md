# Consecutive Integers

Found in chapter one, "Digits", this puzzle is to find the number between 10 and 20 that is not a sum of consecutive
integers.

For example: `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14` so find a number for which that _cannot_ be done. 

After finding the number between 10 and 20, keep going. How high can you go? 


## Bonus
For some more math/programming fun, see what you can find if you alternate the sign each time, or if you switch the sign as you please.
