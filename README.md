# Code Challenges

## Organization
Each challenge should contain a README file that briefly describes what the challenge is. It will also contain the
"seed code" for the challenge (i.e. an empty function where you will write your code and a few basic tests to verify 
your code is doing what it is supposed to). It will also contain an `answers.json` file with a whole slew of tests
you can put your code through once it passes the initial tests. These tests will be included in the seed file, but
there will also be a description of how the data is stored in `answers.json` so if there isn't a seed for the language
you want to solve the challenge in, you can write your own. Please feel free to make a PR with your seed code added to 
the ReadMe so other people can benefit from it!

## Participation
To participate, first, fork the repo. Notice the master branch is _just_ challenges, while the
submission branch has all the challenges _and_ solutions from everyone. Once you have forked the
repo, using the seed code of the desired language, create a code file w/ your name (or github username)
i.e. `jimmykodes.py` in the challenge's submissions directory. Write your code there and then create a
PR into the `submissions` branch from your fork. Please be conscientious of any conflicts when making
your PRs so I don't have to do a lot of extra work to merge your code. Please try and refrain from
looking into other people's submissions until you have actually completed it yourself. No cheating ;)

#### Note:
There are issues created where you can comment and leave ideas for future challenges. This is still
limited to my imagination after all, so I'm all for crowd sourcing some challenge ideas as we go.
